# Python

## Basic

Variable assignment.

- need not declare of the type of value.

We use `print` to output a variable.

`#` is the commet symbol.

conditions

We can use `type` function to get the numerical type.

### Numbers and arithmetic in Python

int, float, str

#### Builtin functions for working with numbers

`min()` `max()` `abs()` `float()` `int()`

>`int('114514')` will get a int number 114514.

### Getting Help

Use the `help()` function. If we add **docstring** to the function defined by ourselves, we can also use `help()` to get something.

### Defining functions

Here is an example to define a function to get the least difference between three numbers:

```python
def least_difference(a,b,c):# notice the colon
    """Return the smallest difference between any two numbers among a, b and c.
    
    >>> least_difference(1, 5, -5)
    4
    """
    diff1 = abs(a - b)
    diff2 = abs(b - c)
    diff3 = abs(a - c)
    return min(diff1,diff2,diff3)
```

#### Functions that don't return

```python
print(1, 2, 3, sep=' < ')
```

#### Functions Applied to Functions

There are two examples.

```python
def mult_by_five(x):
    return 5 * x

def call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on arg"""
    return fn(arg)

def squared_call(fn, arg):
    """Call fn on the result of calling fn on arg"""
    return fn(fn(arg))

print(
    call(mult_by_five, 1),
    squared_call(mult_by_five, 1), 
    sep='\n', # '\n' is the newline character - it starts a new line
)
```

```python
def mod_5(x):
    """Return the remainder of x after dividing by 5"""
    return x % 5

print(
    'Which number is biggest?',
    max(100, 51, 14),
    'Which number is the biggest modulo 5?',
    max(100, 51, 14, key=mod_5),
    sep='\n',
)
```

#### exercises
```python
def to_smash(total_candies,n_friends = 3):# Using n_friends = 3 can set a default argument
    """Return the number of leftover candies that must be smashed after distributing
    the given number of candies evenly between 3 friends.
    
    >>> to_smash(91)
    1
    """
    return total_candies % n_friends
```

### Booleans

>Python has a type of variable called bool. It has two possible values: `True` and `False`.

```python
def can_run_for_president(age):
    """Can someone of the given age run for president in the US?"""
    # The US Constitution says you must be at least 35 years old
    return age >= 35# It returns a boolean value

print("Can a 19-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(19))
print("Can a 45-year-old run for president?", can_run_for_president(45))
```

#### Combining Boolean Values

`and` is prior, but use `()` can make coding more readable.

#### Conditions

`if` `elif` `else`

#### Boolean conversion

```python
print(bool(1)) # all numbers are treated as true, except 0
print(bool(0))
print(bool("asf")) # all strings are treated as true, except the empty string ""
print(bool(""))
# Generally empty sequences (strings, lists, and other types we've yet to see like lists and tuples)
# are "falsey" and the rest are "truthy"
```

### Lists

Here are some examples to create a list.

```python

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]


# We can put other types of things in lists:
planets = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus', 'Neptune']


# We can even make a list of lists:
hands = [
    ['J', 'Q', 'K'],
    ['2', '2', '2'],
    ['6', 'A', 'K'], # (Comma after the last element is optional)
]
# (I could also have written this on one line, but it can get hard to read)
hands = [['J', 'Q', 'K'], ['2', '2', '2'], ['6', 'A', 'K']]


# A list can contain a mix of different types of variables:
my_favourite_things = [32, 'raindrops on roses', help]
# (Yes, Python's help function is *definitely* one of my favourite things)
```

#### index

```python
planets[0]

# Elements at the end of the list can be accessed with negative numbers, starting from -1:
planets[-1]
planets[-2]
```

#### Slicing

What are the first three planets? We can answer this question using slicing:

```python

# That is still a list
planets[0:3]


# It will get the behind elements
planets[3:]


# All the planets except the first and last
planets[1:-1]


# The last 3 planets
planets[-3:]
```

#### Changing lists

```python
planets[3] = 'Malacandra'

planets[:3] = ['Mur', 'Vee', 'Ur']
print(planets)
# That was silly. Let's give them back their old names
planets[:4] = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars',]

```

#### List functions

```python
# How many planets are there?
len(planets)

# The planets sorted in alphabetical order
sorted(planets)

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
sum(primes)

max(primes)
```

#### Interlude: objects

In short, objects carry some things around with them. You access that stuff using Python's dot syntax.\

>For example, numbers in Python carry around an associated variable called imag representing their imaginary part. (You'll probably never need to use this unless you're doing some very weird math.)

```python
x = 12
# x is a real number, so its imaginary part is 0.
print(x.imag)
# Here's how to make a complex number, in case you've ever been curious:
c = 12 + 3j
print(c.imag)
```

>The things an object carries around can also include functions. A function attached to an object is called a **method**. (Non-function things attached to an object, such as imag, are called attributes).

For example, numbers have a method called `bit_length()`. Again, we access it using dot syntax:

```python
x.bit_length()

# In the same way that we can pass functions to the help function (e.g. help(max)), we can also pass in methods:
help(x.bit_length)
```

#### List methods

`list.append` modifies a list by adding an item to the end:

```python
# Pluto is a planet darn it!
planets.append('Pluto')

# `list.pop` removes and returns the last element of a list:
planets.pop()
```
#### Searching lists

Where does Earth fall in the order of planets? We can get its index using the `list.index` method.

```python
planets.index('Earth')


# we can use the in operator to determine whether a list contains a particular value:
# Is Earth a planet?
"Earth" in planets

# Is Calbefraques a planet?
"Calbefraques" in planets
```

#### Tuples

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)

t = 1, 2, 3 # equivalent to above
t
```

They cannot be modified (they are immutable). Tuples are often used for functions that have **multiple return values**.

```python
x = 0.125
x.as_integer_ratio()

# These multiple return values can be individually assigned as follows:
numerator, denominator = x.as_integer_ratio()
print(numerator / denominator)
```

Here is an example to exchange two numbers:

```python
a = 1
b = 0
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)
```
